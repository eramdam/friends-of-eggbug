# Friends of eggbug visualizer

A simple tool to visualize your `find-your-friends.json` file from your [cohost](https://cohost.org) data export in a slightly nicer way.

## Features

- Doesn't send any data anywhere, everything happens locally
- Saves your file in the browser's storage so you can re-open the page later without having to re-submit the file
- Filtering as well as sorting
